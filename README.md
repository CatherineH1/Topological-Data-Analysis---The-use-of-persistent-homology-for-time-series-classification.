# Topological-Data-Analysis---The-use-of-persistent-homology-for-time-series-classification.
This project aims to introduce students of mathematics to the use of persistent homology for time series classification. We will investigate the usefulness and effectiveness of persistent homology in comparison to more traditional methods such as k-means clustering to classify time series. Investigations will be conducted on data from flour beetle populations and musical instruments based on two recent research papers Persistent homology for time series and spatial data clustering - Cássio M.M. Pereira/Rodrigo F. de Mello and “Computational Topology Techniques for Characterizing Time-Series Data” - University of Colorado.
